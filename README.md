![image](./easybid-site%20.png)

- An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

# About the project

- When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

# This is what I have done throughout the process

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may log in
- A registered user may log out
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
- A registered user may use credit to make a Bid on another user’s Listing
- An unregistered user may search through Listings
